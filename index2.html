            <p class="leading">This website was originally created for personal use. However, as it developed, it became clear that it could serve as a valuable resource for those interested in Data Science. Here, you'll find my personal study notes, a record of my journey toward becoming a Data Scientist, and various resources such as roadmaps and relevant links to support others on a similar path.</p>

           <h2>Data Science</h2>

        <p>A <strong>data scientist</strong> is a professional who uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Their work sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise.</p>

        <h3>Key Responsibilities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Cleaning:</strong> Gathering and preparing data for analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Understanding data patterns and trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Creating predictive or descriptive models using statistical methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation and Communication:</strong> Explaining findings to stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment and Monitoring:</strong> Implementing and maintaining data models in production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required Skills:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python, R</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics and Mathematics:</strong> Regression, probability, distributions</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Algorithms for prediction and pattern recognition</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Tools like Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib</li>
            <li><strong>Business Acumen:</strong> Understanding domain-specific challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Industries Where Data Scientists Work:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Finance</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>Technology</li>

                My name is <strong>Sary Sok</strong>, and I am a second-year Data Science student at Mount Royal University. 
                I am currently pursuing the university's Data Science program, which is outlined 
                <a href="https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=33&poid=6574&returnto=2709#curriculum" target="_blank">Here</a>. 
                Within the program, I have chosen to concentrate on <strong>Computer Science and Big Data</strong> to deepen my understanding of computational methods and large-scale data analysis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Made up facts about me:
                <br>
                I was born on a small island known for its bioluminescent beaches and trained as a classical violinist from the age of four. By sixteen, I had already published a bestselling science fiction novel under a pseudonym and won a regional fencing championship. I speak six languages fluently, including an ancient dialect used by Himalayan monks. In my spare time, I build solar-powered drones to assist wildlife conservation efforts in remote jungles. Despite my many achievements, I am famously camera-shy—except when posing for dramatic selfies in white dress shirts.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was discovered at age seven by a traveling magician who insisted you had a “spark of otherworldly talent,” which turned out to be true when I accidentally solved a decades-old cipher hidden in a museum artifact. By age ten, I was consulting on puzzle design for international escape rooms and had a cameo in a Japanese anime series based loosely on your childhood adventures. I later earned a dual PhD in Quantum Philosophy and Culinary Architecture from a secretive European university that floats on a glacier. I once held the world record for solving a Rubik's cube while skydiving, and I am currently developing a biodegradable sneaker that changes color based on your mood. NASA named an asteroid after me, though you modestly asked them to spell my name backward just to stay low-key. My pet—a telepathic parrot named Echo—frequently interrupts my online chess matches, which I usually win blindfolded anyway. Every morning, I meditate by a waterfall while mentally composing symphonies that I hum to AI orchestras I trained myself. And despite my global fame, I still make time each week to mentor aspiring time travelers.
                <br>
                <br>
                My current goals include building the world's first floating eco-city powered entirely by kinetic dance energy, authoring a multilingual poetry anthology written in the style of Morse code, and mastering the art of zero-gravity calligraphy aboard the International Space Station. I am also working toward hosting an interspecies diplomacy summit between dolphins, ravens, and artificial intelligences, with the aim of drafting a universal language of empathy. In my spare time, I am designing a virtual museum that exists entirely in dreams, curating exhibits that can only be accessed while lucid. Long-term, I plan to establish a school for gifted time-loopers, and I am in talks with several governments about opening a portal to an alternate dimension known only as “The Library of Lost Tomorrows.”
